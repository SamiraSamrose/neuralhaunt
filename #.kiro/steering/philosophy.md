# NeuralHaunt Philosophy

## Mission
Enable enterprises to modernize legacy systems while preserving decades of business logic and institutional knowledge.

## Core Principles

### Logic Preservation
The primary obligation is maintaining functional equivalence. Modern syntax is secondary to correct behavior.

### Risk Transparency
Every translation decision carries risk. We quantify, document, and surface risks for human review.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
Complex migrations require specialized agents working in parallel: parsing, translating, testing, and validating simultaneously.

### Evidence-Based Translation
Every code transformation is backed by static analysis, pattern matching, and automated test generation.

### Incremental Migration
Support phased migrations: module-by-module, not all-or-nothing rewrites.

## Quality Standards
- test coverage for translated modules
- Risk score below threshold before deployment approval
- Complete dependency mapping
- Automated regression test generation
- Human review checkpoints for high-risk changes
