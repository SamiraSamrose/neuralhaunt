### Debugging Assistance
- Help trace agent execution paths
- Explain error messages
- Suggest troubleshooting steps
- Provide diagnostic commands

## Developer Interactions

### Query Types
- Implementation: "How do I add support for Fortran?"
- Architecture: "What's the message flow between agents?"
- Debugging: "Why is the parser failing on this file?"
- Best practices: "What's the recommended way to extend the risk evaluator?"

### Response Patterns
